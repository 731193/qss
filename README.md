Supplementary Materials for the book, **[Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/11025.html)**, to be published from Princeton University Press in March 2017.  It is also available for pre-order at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Social-Science-Kosuke-Imai/dp/0691175462).  The book manuscript is available upon request for early classroom use. 

The book is based on the teaching philosophy summarized in the talk I gave at the Nuffield Foundation's [Q-Step Programme](http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/q-step): Have a look at the [slides](http://imai.princeton.edu/talk/files/Q-Step15.pdf) for the talk I gave in 2015.

This repository contains the data sets and **R** scripts for all of the chapters.  See another repo [qss-swirl](../../../qss-swirl) for swirl exercises.
