Supplementary Materials for the book manuscript, ``A First Course in Quantitative Social Science.''

This repository contains the data sets for all of the chapters.  See another repo [qss-swirl](../../../qss-swirl) for swirl exercises.

The book manuscript is available upon request for instructors who are considering using it in classroom.

The book is based on the teaching philosophy summarized in the talk I gave at the Nuffield Foundation's [Q-Step Programme](http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/q-step): Have a look at the [talk slides](http://imai.princeton.edu/talk/files/Q-Step15.pdf)
