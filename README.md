Supplementary Materials for the book manuscript, ``Quantitative Social Science: Introduction,'' to be published from Princeton University Press in 2017

This repository contains the data sets for all of the chapters.  See another repo [qss-swirl](../../../qss-swirl) for swirl exercises.

The book manuscript is available upon request for early classroom use.

The book is based on the teaching philosophy summarized in the talk I gave at the Nuffield Foundation's [Q-Step Programme](http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/q-step): Have a look at the [talk slides](http://imai.princeton.edu/talk/files/Q-Step15.pdf)
