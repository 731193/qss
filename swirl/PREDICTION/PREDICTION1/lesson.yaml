# Question 1
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'True or False: Loops can simplify our programming code when we want to repeatedly execute code chunks over and over again.'
  AnswerChoices: 'True; False'
  CorrectAnswer: True
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='True')
  Hint: See 'Loop in R'

# Question 2
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'To iterate means to'
  AnswerChoices: 'perform repeatedly; perform once; skip over'
  CorrectAnswer: perform repeatedly
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='perform repeatedly')
  Hint: See 'Loop in R'
  
# Question 3
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'In the R expression "for (i in X)" the object "i" is considered a ____________'
  AnswerChoices: 'counter; placeholder; iterator'
  CorrectAnswer: counter
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='counter')
  Hint: See 'Loop in R' 

# Question 4
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Given that "n <- 10", how many times will the loop "for (i in 1:n)" iterate through?'
  CorrectAnswer: 10
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='10')
  Hint: See 'Loop in R'
 
- Class: text
  Output: 'It is often useful to create an empty vector to store the computational output from a loop'

# Question 5
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Create a vector called "output" that is filled with "NA"s and has the length "n". The object "n" has been included in this lesson.'
  CorrectAnswer: output <- rep(NA, n)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='output <- rep(NA,n)')
  Hint: See 'Loop in R'
  
# Question 6
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Use the "cat()" function to put together a phrase and the object "n". The final output should read ''The object n has length 10''.'
  CorrectAnswer: cat("The object n has length", n)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='cat("The object n has length", n)')
  Hint: See 'Loop in R'
  
# Question 7
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'In the conditional expression "if (Y) {expression1}", "expression1" will be executed if "Y" is _____'
  AnswerChoices: 'True; False'
  CorrectAnswer: True
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='True')
  Hint: See 'General Conditional Statements in R' 

# Question 8
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'A conditional statement that is nested within a loop is executed _______ the loop.'
  AnswerChoices: 'inside; outside'
  CorrectAnswer: inside
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='inside')
  Hint: See 'General Conditional Statements in R' 

# Question 9
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'The "%%" operator computes the ___________.'
  AnswerChoices: 'remainder; total; sum'
  CorrectAnswer: remainder
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='remainder')
  Hint: See 'General Conditional Statements in R' 

# Question 10
- Class: mult_question

  AnswerChoices: 'misclassification; error; bad prediction'
  CorrectAnswer: misclassification
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='misclassification')
  Hint: See 'Poll Predictions'
