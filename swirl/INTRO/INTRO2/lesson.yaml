# Question 1
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'How would you multiply 4 by 7?'
  CorrectAnswer: 4 * 7
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='4 * 7')
  Hint: See 'arithmetic operations'
  
# Question 2
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'How would you multiply 2 times the quantity 9 plus 1?'
  CorrectAnswer: 2 * (9 + 1)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('2 * (9 + 1)', '(9 + 1) * 2')
  Hint: See 'arithmetic operations'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'R will treat numbers like characters if you tell it to. However, you will no longer be able to use arithmetic operations on the object.'

# Question 3
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Create an object called "myobject" and assign the value 10 to it.'
  CorrectAnswer: myobject <- 10
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='myobject <- 10')
  Hint: See 'objects'
  
# Question 4  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Replace the object "myobject" with the character ''10'''
  CorrectAnswer: myobject <- '10'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='myobject <- \'10\'')
  Hint: See 'objects'
  
# Question 5
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'What function can we use to tell whether "result" is a character or a numeric object?'
  AnswerChoices: 'which(); class(); is.character()'
  CorrectAnswer: class()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'class()')
  Hint: see 'objects'

# Question 6
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Which function is used to concatenate different elements of a vector?'
  AnswerChoices: 'a(); b(); c()'
  CorrectAnswer: c()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'c()')
  Hint: See 'vectors'

- Class: text
  Output: 'A vector of data called "world.pop" has been loaded with this lesson. The first element is for 1950 up to the last element for 2010.'

- Class: text
  Output: '"world.pop" is a numeric vector so we can perform arithmetic operations on it.'

# Question 7
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Divide each element of "world.pop" by 1000 and assign it to an object called "pop.million".'
  CorrectAnswer: pop.million <- world.pop / 1000
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pop.million <- world.pop / 1000')
  Hint: See 'vectors'
 
# Question 8 
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Which function is used to find the maximum?'
  AnswerChoices: 'min(); max(); sum()'
  CorrectAnswer: max()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'max()')
  Hint: See 'functions'  

# Question 9
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Which function is used to load an external CSV file?'
  AnswerChoices: 'read.csv(); import(); upload()'
  CorrectAnswer: read.csv()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'read.csv()')
  Hint: see 'data files'
  
- Class: text
  Output: 'A data frame object called "UNpop" has already been included in this lesson.'
 
# Question 10 
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'What are the dimensions of "UNpop"?'
  CorrectAnswer: dim(UNpop)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dim(UNpop)')
  Hint: see 'data files'
  
# Question 11  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Call the variable "world.pop" from the UNpop data frame.'
  CorrectAnswer: UNpop$world.pop
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='UNpop$world.pop')
  Hint: see 'data files'

# Question 12
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Use indexing and/or the $ operator to look at the last four observations of the ''year'' variable in the "UNpop" data frame.'
  CorrectAnswer: UNpop$year[4:7]
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('UNpop[4:7, ''year'']', 'UNpop[4:7, 2]', 'UNpop$year[4:7]', 'UNpop[c(4:7), ''year'']', 'UNpop[c(4:7), 2]', 'UNpop$year[c(4:7)]')
  Hint: see 'data files'
  
# Question 13  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Which character is used to write comments?'
  AnswerChoices: '#; *; !'
