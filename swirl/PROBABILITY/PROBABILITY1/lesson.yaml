# Question 1
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'I roll a fair 6-sided die 3,000,000 times. The number 1 turns up approximately 500,000 times, so I conclude that the probability of a 1 is 1/6. This is the ___ approach to probability.'
  AnswerChoices: '"Frequentist"; "Bayesian"'
  CorrectAnswer: 'Frequentist'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='"Frequentist"')
  Hint: See 6.1.1.

# Question 2
- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'Suppose that P(A)=0.4 and P(B)=0.3. What is the minimum value of P(A and not B)?'
  CorrectAnswer: '0.1'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.1')
  Hint: See the Law of Total Probability. What happens if B is entirely contained in A?

# Question 3
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Out of all possible anagrams for the word CHAIR (including the original word), what is the probability that the letter I comes first?'
  AnswerChoices: '0.1; 0.2; 0.3; 0.4'
  CorrectAnswer: '0.2'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.2')
  Hint: See 6.1.3.

# Question 4
- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'A disease affects 1% of the population. The only test for the disease returns positive 99% of the time the disease is actually there, though it returns positive 20% of the time if the disease is not actually there. You take this test and it returns positive. What is the probability you have the disease (rounded to nearest 10^-1)?'
  CorrectAnswer: '0.05'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.05')
  Hint: See Section 6.2 on Conditional Probability.

# Question 5
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'What was the conditional independence assumption we made in our race + surname example?'
  AnswerChoices: 'Once we know the label of the output variable, we can assume that the predictor variables are independent.; Once we know the probabilities of the predictor variables, we can assume that the label of the output variable is independent.; Once we know the probability of the output variable, we can assume the probabilities of the predictor variables are independent.'
  CorrectAnswer: 'Once we know the label of the output variable, we can assume that the predictor variables are independent.'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Once we know the label of the output variable, we can assume that the predictor variables are independent.')
  Hint: See the 6.3.2.
