# Question 1
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Which statement best describes how simple randomization differs from complete randomization?'
  AnswerChoices: 'Only part of our sample is randomly chosen; We randomize part of the sample but do not randomize the treatment; We choose how much of the sample receives treatment a priori; We randomize the sample, a priori'
  CorrectAnswer: 'We choose how much of the sample receives treatment a priori'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='We choose how much of the sample receives treatment a priori')
  Hint: See 7.1.1.

# Question 2
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Let variance and bias be denoted by V(x) and B(x) respectively. Then MSE (Mean Squared Error) equals:'
  AnswerChoices: 'V(x^2) + B(x); V(x) + B(x^2); V(x)^2 + B(x); V(x) + B(x)^2'
  CorrectAnswer: 'V(x) + B(x)^2'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='V(x) + B(x)^2')
  Hint: See 7.1.2.

# Question 3
- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'The variance in a population is 5. For samples of size 10, what is the variance in the sample mean (express your answer to the nearest 0.1)?'
  CorrectAnswer: '0.5'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.5')
  Hint: See 7.1.2. Use the Central Limit Theorem.

# Question 4
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'In the context of confidence intervals, what is alpha?'
  AnswerChoices: 'The probability that over repeated sampling the confidence interval does not contain the true value of a parameter; The probability that the confidence interval contains the true value of a parameter, based on sample size; The probability that the confidence interval contains the true value of a parameter, regardless of sample size; The bias in the probability that the confidence interval contains the true value of a parameter'
  CorrectAnswer: 'The probability that over repeated sampling the confidence interval does not contain the true value of a parameter'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The probability that over repeated sampling the confidence interval does not contain the true value of a parameter')
  Hint: See 7.1.2.

# Question 5
- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'In our sample of voters we find that 70% of the participants support Obama. If we want our 95% confidence interval for the true population proportion to be within +/- 1% of the true value, what is the minimum number of participants we must ask?'
  CorrectAnswer: '8068'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='8068')
  Hint: See 7.1.3. How does margin of error allow us to determine the sample size given a predetermined level of significance?'

# Question 6
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Suppose you wish to test whether education has an effect on wages. What could be the null hypothesis?'
  AnswerChoices: 'Education has no effect on wages; Education has an effect on wages; Wages has no effect on education; Wages has an effect on education'
  CorrectAnswer: 'Education has no effect on wages'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Education has no effect on wages')
  Hint: See 7.2.2.

# Question 7
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'When hiring, large companies get tons of overqualified applicants, so they are fine with rejecting qualified applicants, though they do want to make sure selected applicants are actually qualified. Do large companies care more about Type I or Type II errors?'
  AnswerChoices: 'Type I; Type II'
  CorrectAnswer: 'Type I'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Type I')
  Hint: See 7.2.4.

# Question 8
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'You wish to conduct a study to test whether students at your university sleep more hours than the national average. What t-test should you use?'
  AnswerChoices: 'two sample, one-sided; two sample, two-sided; one sample, one-sided; one sample, two-sided'
  CorrectAnswer: 'one sample, one-sided'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='one sample, one-sided')
  Hint: See 7.2.5.

# Question 9
- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'You have a coin which you suspect is unfair and instead shows heads with probability 0.7. So, you decide to test this by flipping it exactly once: if heads comes up, you say it is unfair, otherwise, you say it is fair. What is the power of this test (express to the nearest 0.1)?'
  CorrectAnswer: '0.7'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.7')
  Hint: See 7.2.6.

# Question 10
- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'Flipping a coin once is not super informative, you think to yourself, and so decide to flip the coin two more times. If any heads appear, you say the coin is unfair, otherwise, you say it is fair. With these three flips in total, what is the power of the test now (express to the nearest 0.001)?'
  CorrectAnswer: '0.875'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.875')
  Hint: See 7.2.6.
